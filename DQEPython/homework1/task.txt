Namely - the counting of identical words in the proposed text (excerpt from the English book). In form of a dictionary
with count after each word (e.g. marcellus 46 times)
As a word, we will understand any sequence of characters separated from other sequences by special punctuation marks
(period, question mark, exclamation point, comma, semicolon, colon, dash, hyphen, parentheses, brackets, braces,
apostrophe, quotation marks, and ellipsis) and of course the space (or spaces) and the end of a line (new paragraph) .
These special characters are certainly not part of the word. Lower and upper case characters are identical.
