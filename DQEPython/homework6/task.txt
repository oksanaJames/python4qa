this homework will be dedicated to working with csv as we agreed at our last meeting.
Use our lecture #5 for references (attached)

Mandatory:
Write a command-line utility that takes  csv file as an input and displays the values for the specified column from this csv. 
For example, in the form of a list where each new value begins with a new line:

readcsv.py -path_cvs C:\example.csv -col_name Marker_Strategy

………………… etc.

Hint: CSV file may have a title bar containing an invalid characters (maybe you noticed in example Market Strategy converted to Marker_Strategy) 
To get around the problem, you may need to clean the headers. For example, deal with invalid characters using regular expression.
